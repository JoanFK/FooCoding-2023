        <h1>Learning Strategies</h1>
          <p>I am a beginner in HTML and CSS so I looked into a lot of inspiration to begin with. I created a semantic HTML layout guided by 
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank"> W3schools</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" alt="MDN Web Doc website">MDN Web Docs.</a>
          My CSS stylesheet is created using references from <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/" target="_blank"> CSS-Tricks</a> and <a href="https://cssreference.io/" target="_blank"> CSS Reference.</a>
          I created a new folder in my repository and pushed my code <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/" target="_blank">on GitHub.</a></p>
